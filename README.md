# SCISSORS-PAPER-ROCK
  My idea is to create an online version of Rock Paper Scissors that allows the player to play against the computer that chooses "rock", "paper", or "scissors" and lets the player interact with it by typing in "rock","paper", or "scissors" and seeing who won and who lost between the two.
